  <h1>👋 Hello! I'm Stankewich Anatoly.</h1>

## 🛠 What I bring to the table:

- **Product & Customer Mindset**  
  I don’t just test features. I advocate for user experience, reliability, and real-world value. Every bug I catch is a step toward trust.

- **Infrastructure-Thinking QA**  
  I design tests with scalability, observability, and environment health in mind from Docker to Kubernetes, logs to metrics.

- **Code-Minded Tester**  
  I write maintainable readable test code not just scripts. Clean architecture, version control, and CI/CD are non-negotiable.

- **Pipeline Enthusiast**  
  There’s joy in watching a well-oiled CI pipeline run: tests triggered, reports generated, feedback delivered - **smoothly and reliably**.
