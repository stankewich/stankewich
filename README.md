  <h1>👋 Hello! I'm Stankewich Anatoly.</h1>
  <p><i>QA Engineer | Infrastructure-minded • Code-driven • Customer-focused</i></p>
  <p>💡 I love automating boring stuff, breaking apps to make them better — and most importantly, <strong>caring deeply about the product and its users</strong>.</p>
</div>

## 🛠 What I bring to the table:

- **Product & Customer Mindset**  
  I don’t just test features — I advocate for user experience, reliability, and real-world value. Every bug I catch is a step toward trust.

- **Infrastructure-Thinking QA**  
  I design tests with scalability, observability, and environment health in mind — from Docker to Kubernetes, logs to metrics.

- **Code-Minded Tester**  
  I write *maintainable*, *readable* test code — not just scripts. Clean architecture, version control, and CI/CD are non-negotiable.

- **Pipeline Enthusiast**  
  There’s joy in watching a well-oiled CI pipeline run: tests triggered, reports generated, feedback delivered — **smoothly and reliably**.

## Tech I use:

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Kotlin, Rust *(for test automation & tooling)*  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Docker, Git, GitHub/GitLab CI, Kubernetes  
- **Observability & Data**: Grafana, Kibana, SQL, NoSQL
